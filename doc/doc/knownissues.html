      <p>This issue only affects some Linux distributions or XFree versions.</p>
      <p>Has been reported that some generated Kylix generated applications don't 
        work correctly in some Linux distros, errors like 'Error loading icons.Bitmap' 
        or 'Bitmap not valid' appear in this cases.</p>
      <p>The workaround for Report Manager version 1.0RC2 and later (Kylix 3):</p>
      <p>- Add/uncomment the line export CLX_USE_LIBQT=true to the repmand.sh 
        file (startup script) so libqt.so (and libqtintf.so) system library is 
        loaded instead of libborqt.so</p>
      <p>The workaround for Report Manager version 1.0RC1 and previous versions 
        (Kylix 2):</p>
      <p>- Remove the libqt.so library provided in the package so the system provided 
        libqt library will be used.</p>

      from an older version of Report Manager make sure to copy dbxdrivers (and 
      recomended also dbxconnections) file to /home/yourusername/.borland directory. 
      If you are installing for the first time Report Manager it will check in 
      that directory and then copy the files in the current dir there.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td> 
      <p>Not all printer drivers supports custom page sizes, some drivers are 
        reported to not work when selecting a predefined pagesize (A2), especially 
        in Windows NT/2000/XP. Some drivers provided by manufactures allow only 
        change page size from page setup dialog and not in runtime. Dot matrix 
        printers are more flexible with page sizes. If you use WinGDI (VCL) driver 
        you will see in the preview exactly the page size supported by the driver 
        using Qt driver (CLX) the preview can show a page size and the final result 
        may differ (printer driver processed).</p>
      <p>Some Windows 2000/NT/XP provided drivers does not allow custom paper 
        sizes, but the drivers provided by the manufacter provide this support 
        (for example Epson FX-880). Also test the driver using draft quality (printer 
        properties) in Win9x/Me dot matrix printers drivers.</p>
      <p>Note: You must have Administrator rights to create custom page sizes 
        in Windows NT/2000/XP, once created by the administrator (preview or print 
        once), the custom page is available for all users using this printer.</p>

      is not affected.</td>

      <p>This issue only affects the Qt Driver (CLX) in Windows systems.</p>
      <p>The printer selection has no effect in Windows systems, the workaround 
        is to call PrinterSetup dialog before printing or use the GDI driver, 
        if you use TCLXReport you can select the driver (rpDriverGDI), this setting 
        is ignored in Linux.</p>

  <tr> 
    <td> 
      <p>This issue only affects some Linux systems the source seems the printer 
        queue, in Kylix2 the issue is related to qt libs and Borland runtime library 
        localization </p>
      <p>The fast and effective workaround is to launch your application setting 
        enviroment variable LC_NUMERIC=en_US, see repmand.sh startup script. Then 
        in your Kylix application you can set the DecimalSeparator and ThousandSeparator 
        variables before print so you can print with your custom locale settings.</p>
      <p>The way to reproduce the bug is:</p>
      <p>The CLX print engine does not work well in some Linux systems/configurations, 
        you can test if your system works ok by writting a small program in kylix 
        and executing it:</p>
      <p><code>DBXConnection1.Connected:=True;</code></p>
      <p><code>printer.begindoc</code></p>
      <p><code>printer.canvas.textout(100,100,'Hello World');</code></p>
      <p><code>printer.enddoc;</code></p>
      <p>If after connecting to a database the printer not works your system have 
        the 'Kylixprintbugfix'. To fix this set Kylix Print Bug Fix in preferences 
        (Report Manager Designer) and try again. At runtime you must set rpqtdriver.kylixprintbugfix 
        variable to true. This can be a X fonts qt inplementation because if you 
        replace the textout by a Rectangle works perfectly.</p>
      <p>The workaround uses metaprint command line tool to print a generated 
        metafile so you must distribute metaprint in the same directory of your 
        exe. </p>
      <p>Kylix 3 solves only the SIGSEV problem but not the silent problem (see 
        release notes of Kylix 3).</p>
