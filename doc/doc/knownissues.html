    <td> 
      <p>Not all printer drivers supports custom page sizes, some drivers are 
        reported to not work when selecting a predefined pagesize (A2), especially 
        in Windows NT/2000/XP. Some drivers provided by manufactures allow only 
        change page size from page setup dialog and not in runtime. Dot matrix 
        printers are more flexible with page sizes. If you use WinGDI (VCL) driver 
        you will see in the preview exactly the page size supported by the driver 
        using Qt driver (CLX) the preview can show a page size and the final result 
        may differ (printer driver processed).</p>
      <p>Some Windows 2000/NT/XP provided drivers does not allow custom paper 
        sizes, but the drivers provided by the manufacter provide this support 
        (for example Epson FX-880). Also test the driver using draft quality (printer 
        properties) in Win9x/Me dot matrix printers drivers.</p>
      <p>Note: You must have Administrator rights to create custom page sizes 
        in Windows NT/2000/XP, once created by the administrator (preview or print 
        once), the custom page is available for all users using this printer.</p>

  <tr> 
    <td>This only happens in some versions of Windows and only with Qt Driver, 
      this is a limitation of system resources, the issue affects Win9x/Millenium/NT/2000, 
      in Windows XP works ok, the VCL driver uses Device Independent Bitmaps and 
      is not affected.</td>

      <p>This issue only affects the Qt Driver (CLX) in Windows systems.</p>
      <p>This is a <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/developer/changes/3.0.5.html" target="_blank">kwown 
        bug of Qt Libraries</a> , it's fixed in 3.0.5, the workaround is to call 
        PrinterSetup dialog before printing or use the GDI driver.</p>

  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td> 
      <p>This issue only affects some Linux systems compiling in Kylix or Kylix 
        2, the source seems the XFree driver and qt libs.</p>
      <p>The CLX print engine does not work well in some Linux systems/configurations, 
        you can test if your system works ok by writting a small program in kylix 
        and executing it:</p>
      <p><code>DBXConnection1.Connected:=True;</code></p>
      <p><code>printer.begindoc</code></p>
      <p><code>printer.canvas.textout(100,100,'Hello World');</code></p>
      <p><code>printer.enddoc;</code></p>
      <p>If after connecting to a database the printer not works your system have 
        the 'Kylixprintbugfix'. To fix this set Kylix Print Bug Fix in preferences 
        (Report Manager Designer) and try again. At runtime you must set rpqtdriver.kylixprintbugfix 
        variable to true.</p>
      <p>The workaround uses metaprint command line tool to print a generated 
        metafile so you must distribute metaprint in the same directory of your 
        exe. </p>
      <p>Kylix 3 solves only the SIGSEV problem but not the silent problem (see 
        release notes of Kylix 3).</p>
