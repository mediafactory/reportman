<h2>Report Manager Server</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Report Manager Server is a multithread service/application that works over 
  TCP/IP protocol. It allows any number of client machines to execute reports 
  obtaining ready to print report metafiles.</p>
<p>You must start the server application (available also as a service) in the 
  server machine, in the server machine you should have database connectivity 
  software so the reports can execute on it.</p>
<p>The database server can be any machine accesible by the report server machine, 
  so you can distribute the work of generating reports, for example the report 
  client can be a Internet enabled connection requesting a report to a far network 
  (also connected to Internet) server, the server generates the report requesting 
  process intensive querys to a high performance database server, after the calculation 
  of the report is done, the server sends the result to the report client.</p>
<p>The report client application can request information about parameters and 
  also alter them before executing the report.</p>
<p>The server and the client are optimized to use very little bandwith.</p>
<p><b>Installation in Microsoft Windows as a Service</b></p>
<p>If you are running Windows NT/2000/XP you can install the server as a standalone 
  service, you must run repserverservice /INSTALL, you shoud have a shortcut available 
  in the start menu inside Report </p>
<p>Manager group. To unistall it you can run repserverservice /UNINSTALL or the 
  shortcut menu.</p>
<p>After installing the service you can set startup options in the same way as 
  other services.</p>
<p><b>Installation in Microsoft Windows as a standalone application</b></p>
<p>If you are running Windows 98/Me you can add a shortcut to reportserverapp.exe 
  in the Start group so it's started after logging. You can also execute reportservercon.exe, 
  to start it as a console application.</p>
<p><b>Installation in Linux as a standalone application</b></p>
<p>To start the server you must execute reportserverapp.sh or reporservercon.sh 
  script, the first need an X Server running because is a X application.</p>
<p><b>Installation in Linux as a service</b></p>
<p>You can run the report server at boot time, the procedure depends in you linux 
  distribution, usually the runlevel to start the server is 3 (console network), 
  that is execute reportservercon.sh.</p>
<p><b>Configuration</b></p>
<p>Report Manager server runs using port 3060, you can run the server as an application 
  and see the report configuration and log files. You can alter all settings using 
  repserverconfig application except the port (you can alter it modifying the 
  configuration file).</p>
<p>By default there is only one user named Admin and widthout password. You can 
  assign a password to Admin user, and add other users. The Admin user is the 
  only one with privileges to add Report Server aliases.</p>
<p>A report alias is a name and a path that points to a directory that can contain 
  reports and directories containing reports so a report tree is generated using 
  the directory structure, the reports are stored in the server and the report 
  tree is send to the report client.</p>
