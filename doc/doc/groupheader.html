<h2>Basic report design</h2>
<h3><b>Group header and footer</b></h3>
<p>Now we will group the sample customers dataset by the first character of his 
  name.</p>
<p>Note that if you want to group data it must be ordered correctly, we can't 
  group the customers by city if they are not ordered by city.</p>
<p>We will count also the number of customers for each initial character, the 
  same procedure you can do for printing order items and order totals.</p>
<p>First add a group with name 'Initial'.</p>
<p><img src="images/groupheader.jpg" width="566" height="539"></p>
<p>Add a expression at group header created with expression property Left(CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER,1), 
  select it, click Copy button, select the footer and Paste it then preview the 
  report, the first letter of customer must be shown at the beginning and end 
  of the report:</p>

<p>To force group change, we must enter the change expression for the group as 
  Left(CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER,1),click 'Header-Initial' item in the design tree and 
  then set the Group Expression, if you preview the report, then the deail sections 
  are enclosed by group header and footer grouping customers with the same initial 
  customer name character:</p>

<p>Lets count the customers by initial character, include a expression in the 
  new group footer, set <i>Expression</i> property to 1, <i>Aggregate</i> to Group, 
  and <i>Ag.Group</i> to 'Initial', also include a label with the <i>Text</i> 
  'Total customers with initial:':</p>

<p>Preview the report and you will see the count for each group:</p>
