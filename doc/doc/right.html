<p>Report manager is a <b>reporting application</b> (Report Manager Designer) 
  and also <b>a set of components for Delphi/Builder/Kylix</b></p>
<p>It's opensource under the MPL license model so <b>you can use it in your commercial 
  software but any enhacements to the engine must be published.</b></p>
<p>Report Manager has many <a href="../features.html">features</a>, including exclusive 
  ones like <a href="../features.html#subreports"> single page subreports</a> ,<a href="../features.html#metafile">metafile

<p>If you are using Delphi/Kylix, you can include the reporting engine in your 
  executables,<b> it adds just 80K</b>, that includes the preview window, complete 
  print dialog, report options dialog...</p>
<p>You can also distribute the report designer, so <b>you modify the reports without 
  modifying your application</b>, the result can be exported to <b>Adobe PDF</b> 
  format.</p>
