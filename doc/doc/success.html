      <p>Since 2 years we have looking for a good reporting tool that can be used 
        in both Windows and Linux environment. Since we found RM we've solved 
        all our problems of compatibility. Now we can deploy the reports that 
        our internal users need. In the past we used to develop our reports in 
        QR/FR but RM is the best tool I ever known, we are happy in our IT department 
        because It let us forget about the painfull work of coversion. By the 
        way, we develop in Delphi 7 / Kylix 3 and use RM v1.6. , INTERBASE v6 
        on linux server. Win98/2000 and Linux RedHat/Mandrake in WK.<br>
