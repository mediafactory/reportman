<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>Engine overview, how it works?</h3>
<p>This is a brief introduction of how Report Manager process a report so you 
  can understand the result and design reports in a efficient way.</p>
<table width="95%" border="1">
  <tr bgcolor="#00FFFF"> 
    <td><b>Report Components</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<table width="95%" border="1">
  <tr> 
    <td width="26%" bgcolor="#FFFFCC"><b>Name</b></td>
    <td width="74%" bgcolor="#FFFFCC"><b>Description</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="26%"><b>Datasets</b></td>
    <td width="74%">Datasets are <b>optional but a report usually prints data 
      stored in datasets</b>, the datasets are opened at the beginning of the 
      process, you can <b>open several datasets and establish relations between 
      them</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="26%"><b>Parameters</b></td>
    <td width="74%">Parameters are variables that can be printed and can be entered 
      by the end user, <b>you can assign parameters to datasets (parametrized 
      querys)</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="26%"><b>Subreport</b></td>
    <td width="74%">A Report contains <b>at least one subreport</b>, if it has 
      more than one the engine will process them in natural order. You can <b>assign 
      a dataset to a subreport</b>, if you assign a dataset the engine will print 
      all the <b>detail type sections once for each record</b> in the dataset, 
      else it will print detail sections once.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="26%"><b>Sections</b></td>
    <td width="74%">A Subreport contains sections (<b>bands</b>), the most common 
      section type is <b>detail</b>, but other are <b>page headers, page footers</b> 
      and <b>group headers and footers</b>. The engine will print page headers 
      and footers as necessary it will check group changes and print group headers 
      and footers and print the detail type sections for each record assigned 
      to the subreport. A section have useful properties like print condition, 
      align bottom, horizontal displacement etc...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="26%"><b>Components</b></td>
    <td width="74%">Each section can contain components, the components are the 
      really printable items, they are <b>labels, expressions (dataset fields), 
      images, drawings...</b>, this componets have properties like Font properties, 
      colour, print condition...</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The engine process subreports, using assigned datasets, printing sections (page 
  headers, footers and details), print a sections means to print all the components 
  contained in it. After a section is printed the print position advances.</p>
