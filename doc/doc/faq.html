<h3><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></h3>
<p><b>Q. Wich development environments supports the engine?</b> </p>
<p>A. <code>In <b>native mode</b> (linked inside the executable or as a borland 
  package):<br>
  - Delphi 4,5 Enterprise. Delphi 6 Professional, Delphi 6 Enterprise. Delphi 
  7 Desktop, Delphi 7 Enterprise, Delphi 7 Architech.<br>
  - C++Builder 4,5 Enterprise. C++Builder 6 Professional, C++Builder6 Enterprise.<br>
  - Kylix 1,2,3 Desktop and Enterprise. Kylix 1,2,3 Open Edition-FreeCLX.<br>
  In <b>ActiveX mode</b> (distribution of Reportman.ocx-Windows only needed):<br>
  - Any Delphi/C++Builder version accepting ActiveX controls (personal editions)<br>
  - Any development environment accepting ActiveX controls, Visual C++, Visual 
  Basic, Visual Foxpro...<br>
  In <b>command line tools mode</b> (executing command line tools):<br>
  - Any language capable of executing command line tools, PHP, bourne shell, python..., 
  command line tools are available for Linux and Windows<br>
  In <b>shared library mode</b>:<br>
  - Any compiler or development enviroment capable of using standard C shared 
  library functions, that is GCC compiler, FreePascal compiler..., distribution 
  of reportmanapiqt.so/reportmanapi.so (Linux) and Reportman.ocx needed.</code> 
<p><b>Q. How can I set report parameters at runtime?</b> </p>
<p>A. <code>CLXReport1.Report.Params.ParamByName('CUSTOMERINI').Value:=2;</code></p>
<p><b>Q. How can I show the parameters before executing?</b></p>
<p>A. <code>if CLXReport1.ShowParams then CLXReport1.Execute</code>;</p>
<p><b>Q. What about passing application opened datasets to the report?</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Place a TRpAlias component beside the TCLXReport</li>
  <li>Assign AliasList property or CLXReport to RPAlias compoenent.</li>
  <li>In RpAlias, List property add items as alias and TDataset component to assign 
    to the report. Note: In Delphi 5, in latest versions you can edit datasets 
    with a visual property editor.</li>
  <li>At runtime:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>var aitem:TRpAliasListIte</code><code>m;</code></p>
<code><p>begin</p>
<p>aitem:=RPAliasItem.List.Add;</p>
<p>aitem.alias:='AREPORTALIAS';</p>
<p>aitem.dataset:=adataset;</p>
<p>end</p></code>
<p><b>Q. How can I alter the SQL sentence of a report dataset before executing 
  it?</b></p>
<p>A. CLXReport.Report.DataInfo.Items[0].SQL:='SELECT....'</p>
<p><b>Q. How can I pass opened connections or path to databases to the report?</b></p>
<p>A. Depend on the database driver used:</p>
<ul>
  <li>BDE should detect opened aliases</li>
  <li>DBExpress: <code>CLXReport.Report.DabaseInfo.Items[0].SQLConnection:=..</code></li>
  <li>ADO: <code>CLXReport.Report.DabaseInfo.Items[0].ConnectionString</code></li>
  <li>Interbase Express: <code>CLXReport.Report.DabaseInfo.Items[0].IBConnection:=..</code></li>
  <li>Other still not implemented, but you can update dbxconnections.ini, because 
    them read the configuration from this file</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Q. How can I set properties of components at runtime in already loaded report?</b> 
</p>
<p>A.You must find the component you want to modify, Report property in TCLXReport 
  is the owner of all report items:</p>
<p><code>uses rplabelitem;</code></p>
<p><code>...</code></p>
<p><code>var acompo:TRpExpression;</code></p>
<p><code>acompo:=TRpExpression(CLXReport1.Report.FindComponent('TRpExpression5'));</code></p>
<p><code>if Assigned(compo) then</code></p>
<p><code>begin</code></p>
<p> acompo.DisplayFormat:='dd/mm/yyyy';</p>
<p><code>end</code></p>
<p><code>Note: When assigning text or expression properties declare the variables 
  you assign as WideString.</code></p>
<p><b>Q. I'm designing a report that will be printed in any matrix printer or 
  receipt printer, how can I use printer fonts to speed up the print process?</b></p>
<p>A. At page setup option of Report Manager Designer you can set use allways 
  device fonts option. Allways install the correct driver for the printer or a 
  driver that printer is emulating.</p>
<p><b>Q. Why Report Manager needs TClientDataset?</b></p>
<p> The engine must be capable of go back one record for the main dataset (Prior 
  procedure) because grouping feature, but some datasets only support unidirectional 
  datasets, I use a patched version of TClientDataset (TRpDataset), that no eats 
  lots of memory like TClientDataset, it frees the records it does not need so 
  the engine can print/proces millions of records without memory problems but 
  a bit slower if you print only a few thousand records.</p>
<p>Because this, Delphi 5 Professional or lower can not be used as native components 
  but you can use the ActiveX control.</p>
<p><b>Q. Is Report Manager Engine Thread Safe so it can be used in multithreaded 
  applications (servers)?</b></p>
<p>Report Manager is thread safe but there are some issues not only related to 
  Report Manager:<br>
  - BDE is not thread safe by default (a session must be open for each thread), 
  you can assign a session to a database report or you can assign a TDatabase 
  directly to the database report component in runtime.<br>
  - Warning about local dabase access modes, some database engines like Interbase/Firebird 
  allow to set a path to the database directly (c:\database.gdb) using local access 
  to database, you must avoid this because it's not thread safe you must use net 
  access mode allways (localhost:c:\database.gdb)<br>
  - Not all VisualCLX components are thread safe so you need to modify this VisualCLX 
  components in the main thread, so the designer package is (becasuse this issue) 
  not thread safe.</p>
<p><b>Q. Can Report Manager print in dot matrix printers in Linux as fast as in 
  Windows?</b></p>
<p>Windows provides drivers and those drivers provide printer specific fonts, 
  so the Windows GDI can merge graphics and texts, the printer driver does the 
  real hard work of printing, Report Manager only search for the best suited font 
  (a printer font) in Windows font list, select it and call Windows specific API 
  to draw the text.</p>
<p>For Linux, Report Manager uses the Kylix graphic engine that uses the Qt graphic 
  engine, the Qt graphics engine writes output usually in postcript and then the 
  printer filter transform it to a understandable language to the printer (usually 
  this work is done by ghostcript).</p>
<p>You must find a print filter or CUPS driver that converts a postcript input 
  from Qt (or any Linux app) to textonly output (or better to graphics and text 
  if exists), may be there is a generic text driver in CUPS or Ghostcript. That 
  is installing a plain text printer driver if it's available.</p>
<p>I don't know the Linux printing procedure in depth so I can be wrong.</p>
<p>Other way to do this is write a driver for Report Manager (now Report<br>
  Manager has three drivers:Qt,PDF,WinGDI), the output of this driver can be<br>
  only text for example, or text with escape codes...</p>
<p><b>Q. Why does my report using Group Headers give strange results?</b></p>
<p>For reports including group headers to work correctly the order of the data
within the report must match the grouping structure of the report. Therefore the
SQL statement returning the data (for example SQL SELECT) must include code to
order the data to match the report definition. </p>
<p><b>Q. Why does my Active Server Page freeze when using the ActiveX control?</b></p>
<p>Active Server Pages (ASP) must not produce any console output for correct
operation. ASP can correctly invoke the ActiveX control to generate PDF output
if the following rules are followed</p>
<ul>
<li>You must use version 1.3+ of the OCX</li>
<li>All of the properties to suppress output and dialogs to the console must be
suppressed </li>
</ul>
<p>Previewing the report will not work from within an ASP program. Printing the
report may also fail based on the printing environment set up on the Web server
running the ASP. </p>
