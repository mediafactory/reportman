<h3>Adobe PDF output</h3>
<p>Native pdf output is implemented, you may experiment that the pdf output is 
  lighting fast compared to Acrobat Distiller and other print drivers that output 
  pdf.</p>
<p>But you may take consideration the following issues and limitations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unicode is not supported</li>
  <li>True type font linking and embedding is available from version 2.2, but 
    see bellow details of the implementation.</li>
  <li>Only Jpeg and Windows Bitmap image formats are supported.</li>
  <li>Compression is available, and used by default, but some pdf viewers does 
    not read PDF compressed files.</li>
  <li>Composite fonts and CID Fonts are not supported.</li>
  <li>The engine is faster and the file is smaller if you use standard Type 1 
    fonts (Courier/Times/Helvetica)</li>
  <li>The TrueType font embedding is not size optimized so the file size of the 
    PDF file will increase for each diferent pdf font. Better optimization is 
    a bit hard to done (remove unused glyphs for example).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linux and Windows, different technologies, different implementation</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft Windows already have a font cache, that is any application can ask 
  information about installed fonts, including obtaining the entire font file, 
  also the operating system will search the most appropiate font when the original 
  font it's not available (font matching). Implementation works for TrueType and 
  OpenType fonts, but some fonts can not be embedded (I didn't found anyone), 
  that is the API does not allow to get font data for that fonts (license?)</p>
<p>Linux does not have a standard font service, there are funtions in the X protocol 
  to retrieve sizing infomation about installed fonts, but this information is 
  not complete, and there is no way to retrieve full font data (the font file), 
  some work have been done, there is a project called X print server in early 
  stages, this requires the installation of a X print server process, and X print 
  client libraries.</p>
<p>Anyway I have not found any console service to provide font maching, font cache 
  and font information retrieval. I see applications like OpenOffice take the 
  font information from the computer executing the X client program not the X 
  server so the X server procol probably does not allow to work with sever side 
  installed fonts.</p>
<p>But a great library is usually available in Linux systems, <a href="http://freetype.sourceforge.net">freetype 
  library</a>, Report Manager implementation is done using the version 2.1.8, 
  but it's compatible with 2.X version, you will find it as FreeType2 in your 
  linux distribution , and the shared object is libfreetype.so.</p>
<p>Unfortunatelly this library does not implement font maching, bug at least it 
  can get full information about font files. Report Manager search at default 
  font directories for fonts when embedding a font is required, the font information 
  is cached, but to retrieve this information costs reading all font files and 
  get information about the fonts (font names, styles...) to perform font maching, 
  but process is done once, but it's expensive when you execute only one report 
  (printreptopdf command line tool for example), note that this overhead will 
  not appear if you don't embbed PDF fonts. The good thing is that you don't need 
  a X server generate the pdfs with TrueType embedding.</p>
<p>The font maching algorith inside Report Manager is really simple, search for 
  the same family name and style, else search for a similiar family name, else 
  get a default font and apply the style.</p>
