<h2>Advanced report design</h2>
<h3>Report files sharing sections</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Usually the reports of a project have the same page header or the same report 
  header. For example if you are designing several reports related to a enterprise, 
  may be interesting to include the logo and the name of the enterprise. Then 
  you cut and paste this header in about 100 reports. As a generic application, 
  when you sell it the new customer wants to change the position of the logo and 
  center the enterprise name, will you change the 100 reports?</p>
<p>The answer to this problem is to store this page header in a external file 
  and especify all the reports to load the page header from this file, so changing 
  this file you are changing the 100 reports at once.</p>
<p>Each section in Report Manager have <b>External path</b> property, when the 
  report is loaded, each section with this property assigned will try to load 
  the section from the specified file.</p>
<p>When working with external sections you are responsible for writing and reading 
  them the first time you define them. <b>The first time</b> you want to include 
  a internal section you assign the External path property, then <b>right click 
  the External Path property and select save option of the popup menu</b>.</p>
<p>figure savesection</p>
<p>Next time you open the report it will try to load the section from the file 
  or field. If you want to use this <b>external section in another report you 
  assign External Path property and select load option of the popup menu</b>.</p>
<p>figure loadsection</p>
