<h2>Report Manager for Dot Net</h2>
<h3><b>Basics</b></h3>
<p>The dot net version of Report Manager is a translation from Delphi to C# of 
  the reporting engine. The port to dot net is still uncomplete and requires still 
  hard work.</p>
<p><strong>How it works now (while testing the port)</strong></p>
<p>A single additional file is installed with the designer package for windows, 
  the file is <strong>printreport.exe</strong>, this is a dot net program.</p>
<p>When you select the dot net driver on database connections configuration, the 
  designer will save the report in a temp file, calling printreport.exe, when 
  you preview or print, the printreport.exe is used instead of the designer itself. 
  You can also test printreport.exe independently, the only requirement is you 
  save the report as xml (select prefered save format in page setup).</p>
<p><strong>Parts already working (Windows)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Print preview and printout</li>
  <li>Label, expression, image, drawing, barcode (partial)</li>
  <li>Data providers: Odbc, OleDB, SQLServer, Firebird (firebird dotnet assembly 
    required)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Missing parts</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Output as pdf, excel, text</li>
  <li>Most of the evaluator functions are still missing</li>
  <li>Linux port, requires winforms on Linux or implementation of pdf output.</li>
  <li>Some barcodes still missing</li>
  <li>Other data providers may be included in the future (MySQL)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Different behaviour</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>You must use dot net syntax for parameters in querys, see documentation 
    in dot net platform sdk.</li>
  <li>In odbc provider you use ? for placing parameters, the parameters will be 
    assigned by position, not by name, parameters by name are not supported by 
    odbc dot net driver, so make sure to sort the parameters to match query position 
    when you use odbc.</li>
</ul>
