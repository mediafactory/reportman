<h2>Advanced report design</h2>
<h3>Linked querys</h3>
<p></p>
<p>A subreport can have only a main dataset, but you can open as many datasets 
  as you want, and you can link this datasets to the main dataset or to other 
  dataset linked to the main dataset. </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li> A main dataset with query to obtain the order lines and order header</li>
  <li>A customers dataset linked to the main datset (customer number) to obtain 
    the data for the customer</li>
  <li>A ship company dataset linked to the customer dataset by (ship company number)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>To link a dataset with another dataset you must select the property Master 
  Dataset. A linked dataset must have parameters, the name of the parameters must 
  be the same as the field names of the linked dataset.</p>
<p>Here is a sample:</p>
<p><img src="images/datalink.jpg" width="547" height="497"></p>
<p><img src="images/datalink2.jpg" width="547" height="497"></p>
<p>Note: With the BDE driver you can link Tables by selecting the correct IndexFields 
  and Master Fields properties like you do in Delphi or Builder.</p>
