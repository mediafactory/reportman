<p><b>Language property</b> allow you to design the report to print it in multiple 
  languages, the language property only affect labels, you design the report in 
  english, then switch to another language, and modify labels, before printing 
  you can switch language from Report Manager Designer and Report Manager components 
  in Delphi/Kylix/Builder (language property).</p>
<p><b>Printer Fonts property</b> allow Microsft Windows platform the option to 
  use printer fonts in dot matrix printers so the report will be printed in Native 
  Printer fonts, with the best precision and speed. To do so you must install 
  the correct driver for the selected printer, or the printer driver that the 
  physical printer is emulating via Hardware.</p>
<p><b>Page margins</b> are used as the origin for printing sections, bottom margin 
  limits the space used in the bottom of the page, and right margin limits the 
  space used to the right of the page that is when printing horizontally (labels 
  for example).</p>
