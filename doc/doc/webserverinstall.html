<h2>Report Manager Web Server</h2>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p><b>Installing Report Manager web server in Microsoft IIS 5</b></p>
<p>Usually you copy the application (rpwebserver.dll) into a directory with privileges 
  to execute binary files.</p>
<p>Open the Internet Information Services administration tool, create a directory 
  (cgi-bin) and alter properties to allow executing applications.</p>

<p><img src="images/webserverinstall2.jpg" width="461" height="465"></p>
<p>You can test the installation by calling the application with /version command:</p>
<p><a href="http://localhost/cgi-bin/repwebserver.dll/version">http://localhost/cgi-bin/repwebserver.dll/version</a></p>
<p>This will give you info about the configuration file the report web server 
  is using.</p>
<p>For security reasons you can't add/remove users or aliases from the web. To 
  configure users and aliases you can use repserverapp(xp) and repserverconfig(xp), 
  execute repserverapp as a privileged user (root or Admin) so it opens the system 
  wide configuration file and have write permissions over it, then execute repserverconfig(xp) 
  and add aliases and users. You can see the generated file location in reportserverapp 
  form, this configuration file will be used by the web report server.</p>
<p><a href="http://localhost/cgi-bin/repwebserver.dll/login">http://localhost/cgi-bin/repwebserver.dll/login</a></p>
<p><b>Installing Report Manager web server in Linux Apache</b></p>
<p>Usually you copy the application (rpwebexe.bin and repwebexe) into a directory 
  with execution privileges, in Suse 7.3, is /usr/local/httpd/cgi-bin.</p>
<p>You must place the configuration file of the server in /etc/reportmanserver 
  file. You can generate it with the <a href="serverserver.html">tcp server application</a> 
  and the <a href="serverconfig.html">tcp server configuration</a>. </p>
<p>This file will contain user information (default user Admin with blank password) 
  and the report directories. A simple file can be:</p>
<p>[ALIASES]</p>
<p>SAMPLE=/var/reports</p>
<p>User running apache process must have read privileges of this directory.</p>
<p>The database configuration files must be placed in directory /usr/local/etc, 
  this files are:</p>
<p>dbxconnections.conf, dbxdrivers.conf</p>
<p>There information about database location, user names and passwords are stored, 
  if you use the designer application (repmand) it usually reads and writes this 
  configuration files to /home/username/.borland directory, you can copy the files 
  from there to the correct directory.</p>
<p>Finally the report server application must link to required libraries, you 
  should place this libs (provided with the report designer) in /opt/kylixlibs 
  directory, because repwebexe.bin application launcher add this directory to 
  the path, otherwise you can add other directory to /etc/ld.so.conf file and 
  run ldconfig command.</p>
<p>To test the server you can write:</p>
<p>http://localhost/cgi-bin/repwebexe.bin/version</p>
<p>It will say you the version and the configuration file location, then you can 
  test the configured reports:</p>
<p>http://localhost/cgi-bin/repwebexe.bin/login</p>
