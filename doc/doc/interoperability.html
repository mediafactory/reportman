<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>Interoperability and standards use</h3>
<p>Report Manager engine can be <b>compiled and linked directly</b> with:</p>
<table width="95%" border="1">
  <tr> 
    <td width="50%" bgcolor="#FFFFCC"><b>Microsoft Windows</b></td>
    <td width="50%" bgcolor="#FFFFCC"><b>Linux</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="50%" height="22"><b>Delphi 4,5,6,7</b></td>
    <td width="50%" height="22"><b>Kylix 2,3 (C++ and Delphi)</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="50%"><b>C++Builder 4,5,6</b></td>
    <td width="50%">&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>For more information see Installation chapter.</p>
<p>A <b>report file (we refer as .rep extension files) can be openened in any 
  platform</b>, they are compatible between platforms and development enviroments</p>
<p>To allow the use of the engine in other languages <b>command line tools are 
  provided</b>, there is a chapter about this tools.</p>
<p>Database connections abstraction is done throught <b>dbxconnections.ini and 
  dbxdrivers.ini</b> files provided by Report Manager Designer or Borland tools, 
  the engine will search an alias and read the parameters to connect to a defined 
  database or dataset. If you use Delphi/Builder/Kylix <b>you can assign opened 
  connections or datasets to a ready loaded report</b>, you can also show the 
  designer to the end user embedded in your application.</p>
<p>The result of processing a report is a set of pages containing graphic elements, 
  they can be stored with a native format (<b>Report Metafile</b> .rpmf) to open 
  or print with other provided tools (metaprint, metaview). You can also save 
  the result in <b>Adobe pdf format</b>. This formats are also portable between 
  platforms.</p>
