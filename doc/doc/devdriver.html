<h3>Driver Architechture of Report Manager</h3>
<p>Report Manager engine is a driver based print engine. That is: you can implement 
  a driver and you get the desired output.</p>
<p>The driver is defined as an interface in the unit rpmetafile.pas, so any object 
  or component can implement it:</p>
<p>IRpPrintDriver=interface</p>
<p>The drivers availabe now are:</p>

    <td bgcolor="#FFFFCC"><b>Unit</b></td>
    <td bgcolor="#FFFFCC"><b>Component</b></td>
    <td bgcolor="#FFFFCC"><b>Platform</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>TRpGDIDriver</td>
    <td>rpgdidriver</td>
    <td>TVCLReport</td>
    <td>Windows</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>TRpQtDriver</td>
    <td>rpqtdriver</td>
    <td>TCLXReport</td>
    <td>Linux/Windows</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>TRpPDFDriver</td>
    <td>rppdffriver</td>
    <td>TPDFReport</td>
    <td>Linux/Windows</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The <b>Web Report server and TCP Report Server always work with TRpPDFDriver</b>, 
  it has not dependences on any Borland Visual Library (VCL or CLX) and can work 
  without a XServer running (console mode).</p>
<p>So a report can be processed directly using one of the drivers above or you 
  can also use any of the drivers to generate a <b>Report Metafile</b>, this is 
  a file that contains all the info necessary to print or display the pages using 
  also same drivers, is the same concept as a PDF File, but it includes additional 
  information like destination printer name, custom paper sizes... A report metafile 
  can be sent to the <a href="installwebreport.html">ActiveX control plugin</a> 
  so it shows or prints it.</p>
<p><br>
  The engine calls driver functions, to know the size of a text or a graphic.</p>
<p>procedure TextExtent(atext:TRpTextObject;var extent:TPoint);stdcall;<br>
  procedure GraphicExtent(Stream:TMemoryStream;var extent:TPoint;dpi:integer);stdcall;</p>
<p>When you work with variable sized sections and components, using properties 
  like AutoExpand or AutoContract, the engine will calculate space for sections 
  and components calling this driver functions.</p>
<p>The internal implementation of TRpGDIDriver and TRpQtDriver have a special 
  property: toprinter, if this property is set the functions about object size 
  are asked to the printer driver (Printer.Canvas and QPrinter.Canvas), and the 
  result may be different than the result using the screen canvas (Preview Window), 
  so you can<br>
  obtain different output results.</p>
<p>That is because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Printer resolution may be diferent than screen resolution.</li>
  <li>Fonts on the screen may be drawn different than on the printer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The PDF driver knows exact size about Fonts and work at a fixed resolution 
  (72 dpi), so the result should be the same in all PDF viewers.</p>
<ul>
  <li>One possible enhacement to the engine could be returning the size of the 
    objects as if they print with current printer, it's not difficult but need 
    testing and have this issues:</li>
  <li> If the printer is not installed it should get the screen canvas.</li>
  <li> If the printer ir offline (in a network) Windows Systems does not allow 
    opening<br>
    t, but an error is raised, this situation must be controlled.</li>
  <li> Texts on the screen may appear incorrectly.</li>
  <li> Implementation requires a little more low level access to printer.</li>
</ul>
