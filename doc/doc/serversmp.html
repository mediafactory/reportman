<h2>Report Manager Server</h2>
<h3>Multiprocessor support and hyperthreading</h3>
<p>Report Manager engine have multiprocessor support feature, that is when you 
  execute it as a service or as a TCP server standalone application or a web server, 
  each petition works in a independent thread (or process) so a machine with <strong>more 
  than one CPU</strong> can distribute threads and <strong>optimize performance</strong>. 
  It <strong>also supports intel hyperthreading technology</strong>.</p>
<p>Note, when using a machine with more than one processor use web server repwebexe.exe 
  for better performance instead the ISAPI module (repwebserver.dll).</p>
<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>
<p>In a SMP machine you must copy the tool printreptopdf.exe in the same directory 
  as the server application (repwebexe.exe, reportserverapp..)</p>
<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>
<p>The server application detects the multiprocessing capability, then for each 
  report execution request it starts a new process calling printreptopdf.</p>
