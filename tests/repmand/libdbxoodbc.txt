Extra Dbxopenodbc options in Connect string
-------------------------------------------
As well as the standard ODbc connect parameters, you can specify 
options private to DbxOpenOdbc in the Database connect string.
These options are stripped out before connect string is passed to Odbc.

DbxOpenOdbc options (and their default settings if not specified)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Boolean options - Specify 0, 1 or X for default

 MetaData=1;            
   Normally, we query the ODBC driver to check if it supports metadata.
   When MetaData=0, we will never ask for metadata.
   You may want to do this if asking for metadata hurts performance,
   or if a particular ODBC driver has bugs in the metadata handling.
 SchemaFilter=0; (default=1 for Oracle)
   When 0 catalog entries for all schemas (owners) are passed back to SqlExpress.
   Sometimes this can hit performance, particularly if you
   have many tables in the catalog. When this option is 1, we only pass back
   objects where schema (owner) matches the SchemaName connection option (which 
   DbExpress automatally sets to be the User_Name of the connection).
 TrimChar=0;            
   Applies to FIXED LENGTH string fields only.
   When =0, we pass fixed length strings back to DbExpress unchanged;
   Normally the DBMS pads strings that are shorter than the defined length with spaces,
   Sometimes this is undesirable (eg, for CHAR(5) you store "Hi", but get retrieve "Hi   ")
   When =1, we strip off trailing spaces from fixed length strings.
 MapInt64ToBcd=1;
   When 1, Int64 is mapped to BCD. (This is the way Borland DbExpress drivers behave
   since DbExpress does not natively support the Int64 field type).
 MapSmallBcdToNative=0;
   When 1, 4-digit integer BCD fields are mapped to Int16, 
   9-digit integer BCD fields are mapped to Int32, and other BCD (decimal) fields 
   with 10 or fewer signficant digits are mapped to Double. 
   (BCD fields with 11 or more digits stay as BCD).
 Catalog=1;  (default =0 for Informix, SQLLite, ThinkSQL)
   ("Catalog" is the ODBC term for Database name, eg "Northwind" in MS SqlServer).
   Normally, we check if the ODBC driver supports Catalog.
   When 1, we pass back the name of the catalog to DbExpress when requested.
   Sometimes the driver incorrectly indicates catalog support, or sometimes including
   catalog info can be cumbersome, so set this option to 0 to prevent Catalog info.
 IgnoreUnknownType=0;   (default=1 for Informix)
   When 0, dbxoodbc will raise an exception if it fetches an unknown field type
   When 1, any unkown field types will be ignored
 MapCharAsBDE=0;    
   When 1, String fields > 255 chars are passed back to DbExpress as string blobs.
 EmptyStrParam=1; 
   When 1, empty (ie string of zero length) are allowed. 
   However. some ODBC drivers do not correctly handle string with zero length. 
   For such drivers it is necessary to replace a zero-length string with null,
   and we will do this automatically if EmptyStrParam=0
 MixedFetch=0;          
   When 1, enable Block Cursors even when fetching large fields
 EnableBCD=1
   When=0, BCD fields are mapped as Float (this is how BDE behaves)
 MaxBCD=0
   When 1, BCD fields of any length are mapped as 32 significant digits.
   This is to handle cases where the ODBC driver returns wrong information.

Integer options
 BlobChunkSize=40960;
 ConPacketSize=4096;

N.B. Default settings listed above might change in the future
